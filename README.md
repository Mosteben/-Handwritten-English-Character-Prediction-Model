# Handwritten English Character Prediction Model

This project implements a handwritten English character prediction model using two popular machine learning techniques: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Overview
The goal of this project is to accurately recognize and classify handwritten English characters. We leverage two models, ANN and SVM, which are widely used in image recognition tasks.

### Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- **ANN** is a computational model inspired by biological neural networks.
- It is particularly effective for image-based classification tasks due to its ability to learn and model non-linear relationships.
- The ANN model in this project consists of multiple layers: input, hidden, and output layers.
- The network is trained using backpropagation to minimize the prediction error.
  
### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **SVM** is a supervised machine learning model that is well-suited for classification tasks.
- SVM tries to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates the classes (in this case, characters) by maximizing the margin between data points.
- SVM with a linear or non-linear kernel (like RBF) can be used depending on the complexity of the data.
  
### Dataset
- Handwritten English character images are used for training and testing.
- Preprocessing steps include image normalization, resizing, and feature extraction.

### Performance
- **ANN** excels in handling complex, high-dimensional data and is robust with a large dataset.
- **SVM** performs well for smaller datasets and provides a clearer decision boundary.

### Conclusion
Both ANN and SVM have their strengths, with ANN being more flexible for deep learning tasks, while SVM is more effective for smaller, simpler datasets. The choice between the two models depends on the specific application requirements, such as dataset size and computational resources.
